# FILMORO
### Main Idea

Filmoro is a web application that provides users with daily movie recommendations based on their preferences. The goal is to help users discover new films similar to the ones they enjoy, without the hassle of searching for something to watch.

## Features

- **User Authentication** – Sign in via Discord or email and password.  
- **Personalized Setup** – On first login, users select their favorite genres and a few films they like.  
- **Daily Movie Suggestions** – Each day (or upon reloading the website), users receive random film recommendations based on their initial selections.  
- **Dynamic Recommendations** – The system continuously refines suggestions to match user preferences.
